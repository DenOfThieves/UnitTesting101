Stop! You have committed crimes against programming. In this lecture, we give you an introduction to the topic of Unit Testing, why it’s necessary for writing good code, and how to do it. School curriculums usually don’t cover this, especially in Game Design, but Unity codebases can get so huge that even small projects become unmanageable without proper tests in place.
